1
00:00:02,802 --> 00:00:08,142
This next video - hi, by the way -
is about color.

2
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:12,805
So like the previous video that I just made,
I looked at shapes,

3
00:00:12,805 --> 00:00:17,672
drawing shapes into a canvas,
using beginner steps with p5js.

4
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:21,161
Maybe you made something
just with shapes,

5
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:25,484
the natural next step is to make
stuff have some color.

6
00:00:25,484 --> 00:00:33,358
so maybe you had a canvas,
perhaps with a rectangle on it,

7
00:00:33,358 --> 00:00:36,323
maybe it has an ellipse on it,

8
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:38,388
maybe it has some lines on it,

9
00:00:38,388 --> 00:00:40,501
perhaps you came up with 
something much more interesting design

10
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:41,225
than this.

11
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:46,920
And now we have to ask the question:
How do I, everything was just black lines

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,792
and white interiors.

13
00:00:48,792 --> 00:00:52,792
So how do I color these shapes?

14
00:00:53,802 --> 00:00:57,984
So, to draw these shapes we learned
a bunch of commands,

15
00:00:57,984 --> 00:01:00,021
but really the word we should
be using is 'functions'!

16
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:09,430
I showed you a bunch of functions:
rect(), ellipse(), line()..

17
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:12,636
These are three functions:
rect() draws a rectangle,

18
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:13,668
ellipse() draws an ellipse,

19
00:01:13,668 --> 00:01:14,573
line() draws a line.

20
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:17,283
These are for drawing.

21
00:01:17,283 --> 00:01:19,698
Now for color there are also functions.

22
00:01:19,698 --> 00:01:22,332
And I think there are three
relevant ones that I want

23
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,332
to look at in this video.

24
00:01:23,332 --> 00:01:26,301
background(),

25
00:01:28,511 --> 00:01:31,427
stroke(),

26
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:33,321
and fill().

27
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:38,514
The background function will
set a color for the background,

28
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:41,915
the entire canvas ... what is the color
that is in the background

29
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:46,448
of the canvas? Although the word 'background'
is a little bit of a misnomer here

30
00:01:46,448 --> 00:01:49,837
even though I'm going to use it
to set the background,

31
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:54,001
the order of when we call 
these functions is quite crucial!

32
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:57,149
And I will show you that as well.

33
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:03,801
stroke() is the function that
sets the color for the outline of a shape.

34
00:02:03,801 --> 00:02:06,668
So what is the color 
of the pixels of a line?

35
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:09,460
What is the color of the outline
of a rectangle?

36
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,561
And fill() sets the color of 
the interior of a shape.

37
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:20,593
So let's say the code for this is:
rect, something or other,

38
00:02:22,513 --> 00:02:24,864
ellipse, something or other,

39
00:02:25,964 --> 00:02:27,561
line, something or other.

40
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:33,221
So now we need to figure out,
if I want to set the stroke or

41
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:36,917
the fill for this rectangle, 
where do I write these functions?

42
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:38,545
Where do I execute these commands?

43
00:02:39,505 --> 00:02:42,853
If I want to set the fill or the stroke
for the circle (the ellipse),

44
00:02:42,853 --> 00:02:44,066
where do I write these commands?

45
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:47,726
And now, order of operations has always
been important but it is particularly

46
00:02:47,726 --> 00:02:49,884
important now. When you call these functions

47
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:53,421
it's like setting the color of a pen.

48
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:57,581
So before I draw the rectangle
I need to set the color of my pen

49
00:02:57,581 --> 00:02:59,580
to red or blue etc.

50
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,745
So if I wanna set the stroke or fill 
of this rectangle

51
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:14,100
I need to write these function calls
before I execute the function rectangle.

52
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,732
And then if the next thing
I do is ellipse()

53
00:03:16,732 --> 00:03:18,955
it will also use that same stroke and fill

54
00:03:18,955 --> 00:03:20,862
and line() will also use 
that same stroke,

55
00:03:20,862 --> 00:03:23,233
not the fill!, because there
is no fill for a line.

56
00:03:23,233 --> 00:03:27,392
So if I want to then change
the color, to have a different color

57
00:03:27,392 --> 00:03:30,924
for the ellipse then I just need 
to add another call

58
00:03:30,924 --> 00:03:34,221
to stroke() and fill() .
After I draw that rectangle,

59
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:37,285
I need to set new 'pen colors'
for that ellipse.

60
00:03:38,015 --> 00:03:41,414
So this is part 1.

61
00:03:41,414 --> 00:03:45,241
Part 1 is I need to put these things
in some proper order.

62
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,804
Part 2 is 'what do I put inside here?'

63
00:03:50,394 --> 00:03:52,641
What do I put inside these functions?

64
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:54,533
stroke(), fill(), background(), etc?

65
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:57,501
That's a very good question!

66
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:59,501
I wish I had time to answer that question.

67
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:01,160
I do. I have to answer it.

68
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,106
Ok, so let's erase all of this 
for a moment,

69
00:04:06,826 --> 00:04:08,501
and let's think about color.

70
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,597
Now there's a lot of ways 
to describe color, in the world.

71
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:17,630
I could get some paint, which would 
just say the word 'red' on the can,

72
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,357
that would mean that there's red there,

73
00:04:19,357 --> 00:04:21,922
but we need a mechanism,
a methodology,

74
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:23,420
we need a system for defining color

75
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:32,511
in p5.js, and we're going to use
[unintelligible]

76
00:04:32,511 --> 00:04:39,085
And a basic way that I'm going to look at
it with you is RGB color.

77
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:43,041
Meaning: a color is a combination
of an amount of red,

78
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,897
an amount of green and
and amount of blue.

79
00:04:45,897 --> 00:04:48,865
So, for example:

80
00:04:49,815 --> 00:04:56,689
if I say stroke(255,0,0);

81
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:57,960
what does that mean?

82
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,865
Well, stroke() can accept 3 arguments,

83
00:05:00,865 --> 00:05:03,656
the first one being the amount of red,

84
00:05:03,656 --> 00:05:06,060
the second one being the amount of green,

85
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,353
and the third one being the amount of blue.

86
00:05:09,413 --> 00:05:12,385
So you can now sort of guess
... there's clearly

87
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:15,804
no green and blue because 
I've set their value to 0.

88
00:05:15,804 --> 00:05:18,645
However there is some amount of red.

89
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:21,948
255? Does that mean like a little bit of red?
A lot of red?

90
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:25,981
It turns out it means
the maximum amount of red!

91
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:29,044
So the range for these arguments

92
00:05:30,574 --> 00:05:33,321
is between 0 and 255.

93
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,177
Meaning there are 256 possibilities.

94
00:05:37,177 --> 00:05:43,740
And I'm spending a minute
to mention [ramble]

95
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,501
this because this way of counting will 
come up again and again in programming!

96
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,969
Let's say I said: 
the range is between 0 and 9,

97
00:05:51,969 --> 00:05:55,133
how many possibilities are there?

98
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,323
There's 10, right?

99
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,101
I'm just gonna take a moment 
to prove this to myself:

100
00:05:59,101 --> 00:06:02,566
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

101
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,426
Woah!

102
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:06,400
Right, I counted to 10!

103
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,265
This is confusing. See? 
I got to 9 but there are 10.

104
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:15,205
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

105
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:16,583
Boy, I really have turned 
into a crazy person,

106
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:17,992
counting on my fingers
in a room by myself,

107
00:06:17,992 --> 00:06:19,349
with cameras pointing at me!

108
00:06:19,349 --> 00:06:22,706
So this is the range.
Why does it have this range?

109
00:06:22,706 --> 00:06:25,609
It has to do with the way
that information is stored

110
00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:28,576
in the computer's memory,
and bits and binary numbers,

111
00:06:28,576 --> 00:06:30,512
and all that stuff, 
and I would love,

112
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:35,272
no, actually wouldn't love,
but I could talk about that more.

113
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:37,631
But you can find another video,
or maybe I make another video,

114
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:39,021
or send me an e-mail or something,

115
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:41,148
we'll find a way to talk about it more.

116
00:06:41,148 --> 00:06:44,585
Right now it's easiest for us 
to just think of: this is the range!

117
00:06:44,585 --> 00:06:46,553
And you can change that range too,

118
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:49,117
there's a function in p5 that
allows you to adjust that range

119
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:51,408
but for now, let's keep that range!

120
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:52,814
0 to 255.

121
00:06:52,814 --> 00:06:59,781
So, by the way, fill()
will also take RGB with a range of 0-255.

122
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:06,909
background() will also take the same range, RGB.

123
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,168
So let's go look at that now!

124
00:07:10,338 --> 00:07:13,137
Ok, I have preceded here a little program

125
00:07:13,137 --> 00:07:15,669
that's drawing this little alien creature

126
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,752
and what I would like to do
is to take a moment

127
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:21,125
to add some color.

128
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,593
And this is an excuse to look
at a couple of other things.

129
00:07:24,593 --> 00:07:27,397
Number 1 is: you can add comments
into your program.

130
00:07:27,397 --> 00:07:30,333
The way that you add comments
is with a slash, slash //

131
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:36,061
If you add // to a line of code the computer
will completely ignore that line of code!

132
00:07:36,061 --> 00:07:39,284
Meaning it's not executed,
so you can put whatever you want.

133
00:07:39,284 --> 00:07:42,209
You could write little notes to yourself,
or little secret notes to a friend

134
00:07:42,209 --> 00:07:45,044
who's looking at your code later, 
whatever you like to do.

135
00:07:45,044 --> 00:07:47,304
But here you can see a typical use.

136
00:07:47,304 --> 00:07:49,676
Well, this rectangle is the body of this,

137
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:51,000
this ellipse is the head,

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:58,565
these two ellipses are the eyes,

139
00:07:58,565 --> 00:08:00,633
and these two lines are the legs.

140
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:03,341
So this is a useful thing
to get a habit of this now,

141
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:06,633
if you can get yourself to do it
it will make things easier later.

142
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:13,728
So, for example, if I just add 
fill(255,0,0); and I hit play,

143
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:15,792
you can see:
everything is all red,

144
00:08:15,792 --> 00:08:17,958
all the shapes have now a fill of red.

145
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:23,554
But if I come down here
and say: fill(0,255,0);

146
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:24,925
and look what I have done ...

147
00:08:24,925 --> 00:08:27,425
no red, all green, no blue.

148
00:08:27,425 --> 00:08:32,957
And now you can see
the eyes have a fill of green.

149
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:34,694
Now does anything come after the eyes?

150
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:37,077
Just the legs. 
And the legs don't have a fill,

151
00:08:37,077 --> 00:08:38,662
so green only affected the eyes.

152
00:08:38,662 --> 00:08:44,837
And I could say here:
fill(0,0,255); and I could hit 'run' again

153
00:08:44,837 --> 00:08:51,068
and we see now that the body is red, 
the eyes are green and the head is blue.

154
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:52,213
Now interestingly,

155
00:08:52,213 --> 00:08:55,362
this order of operation is really important!

156
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:59,541
Notice how the head 
is drawn after the body.

157
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:03,898
Let's just vary briefly,
move the head

158
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:06,297
above the body,

159
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:09,525
and you can see what's going on here:

160
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:12,024
that rectangle is covering that ellipse.

161
00:09:12,024 --> 00:09:18,026
So p5 is going to draw the shapes,
layer them in the order

162
00:09:18,026 --> 00:09:20,252
of the sequence of the code in draw().

163
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:21,752
So that's a key piece!

164
00:09:21,752 --> 00:09:24,993
Just in the way that this design works

165
00:09:24,993 --> 00:09:27,348
is the head has got to come
after the body,

166
00:09:27,348 --> 00:09:31,482
so that it covers up 
that top portion of the rectangle.

167
00:09:31,482 --> 00:09:35,785
And the same is true
in terms of fill() and stroke().

168
00:09:35,785 --> 00:09:38,513
If I take this red fill and 
put it after the body,

169
00:09:39,623 --> 00:09:41,917
the body is no longer red,

170
00:09:41,917 --> 00:09:45,471
because I called fill() after rect().

171
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,843
So that red fill has to go before rect()!

172
00:09:47,843 --> 00:09:50,438
That's kind of a crucial
piece of information as well.

173
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:51,240
The other thing

174
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,532
we should notice here

175
00:09:53,532 --> 00:09:55,033
is that I have background() here.

176
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:57,003
Now let's make background() 
some ...

177
00:09:57,003 --> 00:09:59,661
so, first of all, you can combine, 
you don't just have to do

178
00:09:59,661 --> 00:10:00,869
all red, and no green and no blue.

179
00:10:00,869 --> 00:10:07,390
[ramble]

180
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:08,921
You can obviously combine 
colors,

181
00:10:08,921 --> 00:10:11,762
you put red and green together,

182
00:10:11,762 --> 00:10:12,825
and you get something,

183
00:10:12,825 --> 00:10:17,294
like ... let's put a little red,
a little green and no blue,

184
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,814
you can see you get 
a different kind of green.

185
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:22,181
Let's put a lot more red ...

186
00:10:22,181 --> 00:10:25,117
you get kind of a yellowish,
greenish thing ...

187
00:10:26,577 --> 00:10:28,553
So you can see that
you can start playing around

188
00:10:28,553 --> 00:10:30,585
with different amounts of
red and green.

189
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:32,376
But notice how that background() there

190
00:10:32,376 --> 00:10:37,125
background, you think like, 
it's drawing the background,

191
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:39,542
so whenever I call background()
with a color it should put

192
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:42,041
everything behind, 
but all background() is doing

193
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,106
is actually filling the entire canvas 
with a color.

194
00:10:44,106 --> 00:10:48,280
So if I were to take background()
and put it at the very end

195
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,737
of draw() ... you can see background()
is now called after all the code

196
00:10:51,737 --> 00:10:54,335
I won't see anything at all!

197
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,137
All those things were drawn, 
but when we get to the end of draw()

198
00:10:57,137 --> 00:10:59,701
to see the results, 
background() has covered everything!

199
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:03,041
So this is another reason
why the order of operations is important.

200
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:09,169
And I'm mostly finished now but I want 
to mention two other things about color!

201
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:13,997
So let's look at something:
in background(), let's say

202
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:18,560
I put 50, 50,50.

203
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,938
What did I get?

204
00:11:20,938 --> 00:11:22,417
I got this kind of dark grey.

205
00:11:22,417 --> 00:11:26,655
Let's make it: 150,150,150.

206
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:29,258
I got this light grey.

207
00:11:29,258 --> 00:11:30,549
So one thing you'll notice:

208
00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:34,113
if the red value equals the green value
equals the blue value

209
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:38,448
you get a greyscale color.

210
00:11:39,468 --> 00:11:43,386
All 0 being all black,
all 255 being all white.

211
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:44,114
Why is this?

212
00:11:44,114 --> 00:11:49,518
So the reason why this is,
is that color here works the same way

213
00:11:49,518 --> 00:11:51,145
color works with light.

214
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:55,614
If you take a bright red flashlight,
and a bright green flashlight

215
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,842
and a bright blue flashlight,
you shine em all together,

216
00:11:57,842 --> 00:12:00,166
you add all the colors together,
adding up colors,

217
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:03,501
you get things brighter and brighter,
you'll get white.

218
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:06,001
No color, the absence of color,
is black.

219
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:09,685
So greyscale color is something
you might want to use kind of often

220
00:12:09,685 --> 00:12:12,861
and it's inconvenient to write
150,150,150

221
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:16,090
so one of the things that you
can do is also call all these functions

222
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:20,331
background(), stroke() and fill()
with only a single argument!

223
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:23,394
If you use a single argument
you get the greyscale color.

224
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:24,860
So that's an important thing.

225
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,589
The other thing I should mention,

226
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:29,244
kind of briefly,

227
00:12:29,244 --> 00:12:32,413
but we'll have to dive in a little more,

228
00:12:32,413 --> 00:12:34,349
these functions,

229
00:12:34,349 --> 00:12:37,121
we looked at how these functions
always take 3 arguments,

230
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,708
and now we saw how they
could take one argument.

231
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,388
There's another possibility!

232
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:45,289
They can also take 4 arguments.

233
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:50,878
And that last argument 
is transparency.

234
00:12:50,878 --> 00:12:52,941
Sometimes referred to as 'alpha'.

235
00:12:52,941 --> 00:12:54,537
Transparency.

236
00:12:54,537 --> 00:12:57,472
All the colors have been fully opaque,

237
00:12:57,472 --> 00:12:59,138
so when you put a shape
on top of another shape

238
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:00,909
it completely blocks out the other shape.

239
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:03,234
But if you want to create the illusion
of it being see-through,

240
00:13:03,234 --> 00:13:05,493
you can add a 4th argument:

241
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:08,637
0 being completely see-through,
you can't even see the color at all!,

242
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:13,461
255 being 100% opaque,
that's what we've been doing already.

243
00:13:13,461 --> 00:13:15,588
So let's look at that very briefly.

244
00:13:15,588 --> 00:13:18,329
I think a nice play to see that
would be with the head,

245
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:20,722
let's see what we got here ...

246
00:13:20,722 --> 00:13:23,657
So remember how that head 
was covering up this rectangle

247
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:29,254
What if I add a 4th argument 
to the fill and I say like 100?

248
00:13:31,044 --> 00:13:35,033
You can see now that that head 
is now transparent.

249
00:13:35,033 --> 00:13:37,937
So it has its own fill
but you can see what's behind it.

250
00:13:37,937 --> 00:13:40,761
There's obviously a ton of stuff
that you could do with,

251
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:42,586
colors, and combining,
and shapes, in a million

252
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:44,230
different ways.
Hopefully this gives you

253
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:47,957
a basic start and what I would say is
if you were working on a design

254
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:50,813
that you have done after watching
a previous video,

255
00:13:50,813 --> 00:13:52,521
now try to add some color with it!

256
00:13:52,521 --> 00:13:56,717
And again, just to mention, what I would
recommend you do ...

257
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:03,680
is go to p5js, go to 'reference',

258
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,217
go to 'color'

259
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:14,441
and you can see 
here are the functions

260
00:14:14,441 --> 00:14:15,813
that you might want to take a look at.

261
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,605
fill(), stroke(), background(),
by the way,

262
00:14:18,605 --> 00:14:24,237
noFill(), if you want to have no color
for the interior of your shape,

263
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:26,268
noStroke() if you don't want
to have an outline,

264
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:29,770
colorMode(), that's that function
I was kind of mentioning you could

265
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:33,365
change the range, if you don't wanna
have your colors between 0 and 255,

266
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:34,574
you wanna go between 0 and 100,

267
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:37,138
there's also other ways of 
thinking about color,

268
00:14:37,138 --> 00:14:38,896
you can dive into that a bit yourself

269
00:14:38,896 --> 00:14:42,220
but again, the nice thing about 
working with p5 is you can go

270
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,625
here and you can just hit 'edit'

271
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,454
and you can play around 
and say: ok, this is greyscale,

272
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:50,854
and I'm gonna change it to RGB,

273
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:51,926
and run it,

274
00:14:51,926 --> 00:14:52,917
and see what I get ...

275
00:14:52,917 --> 00:14:57,483
but you can see there is lots 
of different ways you can do color

276
00:14:57,483 --> 00:15:01,549
actually in p5 and I barely just
scratched the surface of it!

277
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:04,460
Ok, but this has got to be the end of this video!

278
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,145
15 minutes long, 
which is a very long time,

279
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:08,389
in the Internet world,

280
00:15:08,389 --> 00:15:12,517
and I'm gonna eat some lunch now
before I fall over!

281
00:15:12,517 --> 00:15:15,049
Ok, have a good rest of your day!

282
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:16,740
And I'll be back for more later.
